## Principles

1. Prefer services that does not need identity
2. [Selfhost](https://github.com/anton-isidore/articles#selfhosting-independence-antifragility) as much as possible (then you dont need to create identity for external sevice)
3. Do not share your real name, address, birthsday, anything ... online
4. Delete everything you can what is already out there. But also accept that it is not 100% possible.

2. Do everything over Tor
3. Generate random name (for example: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=random+name)
4. For this name, create anonymous email (for example: https://protonmail.com/)
5.
