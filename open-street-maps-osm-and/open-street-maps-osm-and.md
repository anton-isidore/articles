## OpenStretMaps: OsmAnda~

Start using OpenStreetMaps. The map is much better then GoogleMaps, I have GMaps only to check restaurant, which are not covered well on OpenStreetMaps.

1. Download osmand.net

2. It's local first app, so you have to download the map of the area. 

3. OsmAnd has a bit harder UI but there is so much features.

4. The important thing is to realize that you have multiple UI profiles (for car/war/bike/...). So you can set different level of detail to see and define for yourself what is relevant for you in given situation.

More tips in upcoming posts.

At OsmAnd you can (and should) download slopes, hillshades and contour lines.

You just go to Download Maps, then you select region and beside standart map you also download Contour lines, hillshades and slopes
