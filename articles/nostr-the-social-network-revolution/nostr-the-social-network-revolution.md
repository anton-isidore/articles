## Nostr: The Social Network Revolution
Nostr is the [https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr](protocol). Not the Social Network itself. Nostr alows you to send events. Everything there is event. Applications (like Social Networks) are then build on top of that.

### Why is Nostr revolutionary?

1. **Noone can take it down.** There is no central server, only clients and relays. If someone take a relay down, no problem, you use a different one.
2. **There is no authority to censor you.** Yes, relay may kick you out, it's same as in the point 1 .above, you just use different one.
3. **You decide what to consume.** You queries the relays for data and it's up to you (or your client) to display them in any form. There is **no evil Algorithm that gives you stuff you don't want** to manipulate you mind.
5. **No-one can cancel your account.** As long as you keep your private key secret, you OWN your idenity (the public key).
6. **Nostr is permission-less.** There is no sign-in, no gatekeeper to let you in. Everyone can create an identity just by generating keys.

### Solution to the Spam Problem: The payed relay

Explanation why you need payed relay and how they solve the Spam Problem: [https://relay.exchange/why-pay-2-relay/](Why use Paid Relays?).

The list of available relays that you can buy is available on [https://relay.exchange/](https://relay.exchange/). Currently they cost few thousands of sats as one-time payment, but I think this will change towards (montly?) subscriptions.

**My bought relays:**
- `wss://eden.nostr.land`
- `wss://bitcoiner.social`
- `wss://bitcoinmaximalists.online`
- `wss://nostr.gives.africa`
