## Nostr: The Social Network Revolution
Nostr is the [https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr](protocol). Not the Social Network itself. Nostr alows you to send events. Everything there is event. Applications (like Social Networks) are then build on top of that.

1. Nostr network consists only of Clients and Relays. There is no central server, no central authority. This makes it **robust** and **censorship resistant**.
2. Nostr is local, **you decides what you fetch from relays** (folows are just filters used to fetch data). There is **no evil Algorythm that gives you stuff you don't want** to manipulate you mind.


### Solution to the Spam Problem: They payed relays

Explanation why you need payed relay and how they solve the Spam Problem: [https://relay.exchange/why-pay-2-relay/](Why use Paid Relays?).

The list of available relays that you can buy is available on [https://relay.exchange/](https://relay.exchange/). Currently they cost few thousands of sats as one-time payment, but I think this will change towards (montly?) subscriptions.

**My bought relays:**
- `wss://eden.nostr.land`
- `wss://bitcoiner.social`
- `wss://bitcoinmaximalists.online`
- `wss://nostr.gives.africa`
