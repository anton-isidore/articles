## Reasonably anonymouse Phone & SIM setup

### The Problem

Your phone tracks you. Your every move. There is nothing you can do about it (if you want to be online). 

### The Solution

> **❗If you want to do hight profile stuff, never have phone on you❗**

But if you are a normie who wants reasonable privacy/anonymitiy here is what to do:

1. Buy a [Pixel Phone](https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices) (anonymously!)
2. Go to some **crowded place**, **reasonably far from your home** and turn it on and connect it to some public wifi (you have to do this to [enable OEM unlocking](ttps://grapheneos.org/install/web#enabling-oem-unlocking))
3. Install [Graphene OS](https://grapheneos.org/install/web)
4. **Turn on the Flight Mode** and **NEVER** turn it off ever again
5. Change tiles in the top (drop down menu) and remove Flight More from it, to prevent accidentally switching it off
6. From now on, your primary phone only connects to wifi

But camping public wifis is not very convinient. But having a SIM card in the Pixel is no-go as it would broadcast [IMEI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Equipment_Identity) which is impossible to change in all modern phones.

1. Buy the [Mudi 4G LTE GL-E750](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-e750/) router (anonymously!)
2. Buy anonymous SIM card (in some countries where there are legal) with data
3. Install [Blue Merle](https://github.com/srlabs/blue-merle) plugin into your Mudi Router
4. Chnage IMEI and insert the SIM
5. Connect your Pixel Phone to this router over wifi

### Important opsec stuff to do   
1. Buy all hardware and SIMs anonymously, pay for it anonymously
2. Swap SIMs regullary (and change IMEI before you insert the new SIM)
3. Avoid same location patterns (locations, same people who have their non-anonymous phones, ...) with different SIMs, it may deanonymise you. **❗This is super hard to do right, so if you want to do hight profile shit, never have phone on you❗**
4. When swapping SIM and IMEI, move to different location. Same issue as point 3.
