# Becoming anonymous

## Principles

1. Prefer services that does not need identity
2. [Selfhost](https://github.com/anton-isidore/articles#selfhosting-independence-antifragility) as much as possible (then you dont need to create identity for external sevice)
3. Do not share your real name, address, birthsday, anything ... online
4. Delete everything you can what is already out there. But also accept that it is not 100% possible. Internet remmembers!

## Every use-case has its own identity

1. Use password manager to orgnanize identities
2. Do everything over [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)
3. Generate random name (for example: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=random+name)
4. For this name, create anonymous email (for example: https://protonmail.com/)

## Shopping/Shipment

2. Always ship to shops or some box-like servicies that allow anonymous pickups
3. Wear mask
4. Pay in cash or BTC

## Phone
