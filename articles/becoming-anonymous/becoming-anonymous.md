# Becoming anonymous

## Principles

1. [Selfhost](../independence-self-hosted-encrypted-file-sharing-backups/independence-self-hosted-encrypted-file-sharing-backups.md) as much as possible
2. Prefer services that does not require identity
3. Do not share your real name, address, birthsday, anything ... online
4. Delete everything you can what is already out there. But also accept that it is not 100% possible. Internet remmembers!

## Every use-case shall have its own identity

1. Use password manager to orgnanize identities
2. Do everything over [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)
3. Generate random name (for example: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=random+name)
4. For this name, create anonymous email (for example: https://protonmail.com/)

## Shopping/Shipment

1. Do not ship to your address
2. Always ship to shops or some box-like servicies that allow anonymous pickups
3. Wear mask
4. Pay in cash or Lightning Newtwork/BTC (but do your homework and learn [how to use it anonymously](../bitcoin-anonymously/bitcoin-anonymously.md))/Monero

## Phone

1. Use anonymous SIM
2. Use flight-mode often
3. Do not use iPhone
4. Use phone [without Google](../android-without-google/android-without-google.md)
5. Do not use any "tracking" service like Google Spyware
6. Use only [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
