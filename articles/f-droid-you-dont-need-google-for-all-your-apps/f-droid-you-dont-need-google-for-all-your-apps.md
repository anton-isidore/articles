# F-Droid: You don't need Google for all your apps

The monopoly of Google and Apple over the mobile devices world looks scary. But don\'t despair. You don\'t need to fully depend on Big Google Brother.

I would like to present **the alternative to the Google Play Store** and **a list of free apps there** that I really like.

## F-Droid

[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) is an alternative to the Google Play Store. It allows you to download apps from their repositories that include only [free software](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/FAQ_-_General/#why-isnt-my-favourite-app-included). You can also add other repositories in a very similar way you may know from [other ecosystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_repository).

Just download it, install it and **break your Google cage** a little bit.

## List of apps I use and love

I really love simplicity! I love it when the app focuses on just the one thing and has a clean UI.

> The list is my *opinionated* recommendation of apps I use regularly in my day-to-day life. I have no other affiliation with any of those apps.

### Insular
This [Insular](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.oasisfeng.island.fdroid/ uses [Work Profile feature](https://support.google.com/work/android/answer/6191949?hl=en) of Android to create separate isolated environment. I have all non-FOSS apps locked in that environment and I have this profile turned OFF 99% of the time.

### NewPipe (YouTube)

The [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/) dwells on the well deserved first place on this list. It is the absolute killer. It allows you to play YouTube videos **privately** without the need to login and **without adds**. It also allows you to **download videos**.

### Escapepod asn AntennaPod (Podcast)

The [Escapepod](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.y20k.escapepod/) is a no-clutter app focused on delivering only features that matter. The maintainer is super-responsive on bugs and suggestions. I love it.

The [AntennaPod](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.danoeh.antennapod/) is full featured app for full podcasting experience. 

### Simple Gallery

Despite the name, the [Simple Gallery](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro/) is fully featured with smooth UI. I have found this app as a fitting replacement for Google Photos which I don\'t trust.

The app is from the [Simple Mobile Tools](https://www.simplemobiletools.com/) project that aims to create all the basic apps to replace the bloated pre-installed crap you got with the phone. Sadly, not all of their apps are on F-Droid and the quality of their apps varies. I would say the gallery is the best one.

### OsmAnd~ (Maps)
This [maps-app](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.osmand.plus/) is quite a good replacement for Google Maps. Those maps works offline (you have to download them).

Those mapps totally rocks! They have much much better map data then anybody else. The UI of the app is quite complicated, but it worths to learn how to use it. There is every bench, every crosswalk, you can see what surface the road has or how good is the quality of the surface.

Also it is good idea o bookmark (and download) [Map Legend](https://osmand.net/help-online/map-legend/). 

Check also [the official page](https://osmand.net/) for more information.

### Syncthing (File synchronization)
[Syncthing](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid/) allows to synchronize files betwen multiple devices. It is great alternative to "cloud" servicies like Dropbox or GoogleDrive.

### Book Reader

[Book Reader](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.bookreader/) is the simplest and UI-cleanest app I was able to find for reading eBooks. It has all the features I need (i.e. quick way to translate stuff and bookmarks).

### Etar (Calendar)

[Etar](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ws.xsoh.etar/) is great calendar app that replaces Google Calendar well.

### DecSync CC (Contact & Calendar synchonization)
[DecSync CC](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.decsync.cc/) allows to have contacts, calendars, notes synchronized as files in any given directory. Synchronization of this directory can be done by other app (for example [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)).

To migrate the existing contacts and calendars you can use [this app](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.sufficientlysecure.ical/) (it's UI is little bit old-school, but it gets the job done).

### Tasks

For tasks/todos I chose an app called simply [Tasks](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.tasks/). It can be connected to EteSync as well and easily replaces [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) (which won\'t run on the phone without Google play services).

### Markor (Notes)
The app [Maror](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.gsantner.markor/) is greate markdown based note app that uses simple files to store your notes. It supports encryption and you can easily synchonize your notes as files for example [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/).

### KeePassDX (Password manager)
[KeePassDX](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.kunzisoft.keepass.libre/) is app that works witk KeyPass files.

### Socail Networks (read only)
The absolutely amazing app for Twitter is [Friter](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.jonjomckay.fritter/). It is inspired by NewPipe and works as a reader of Twitter witthoutt the account.

For Reddit there is [Slide](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/me.ccrama.redditslide/)

- **Do not use Facebook** but if you must there is [Frost](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.pitchedapps.frost/)
- For Twitter there is (currently open Beta) project [TwidereX](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.twidere.twiderex/). It is next version if original [Twidere](https://twidere.com/). 

### Keyboard

The [OpenBoard](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.dslul.openboard.inputmethod.latin/) supports multiple languages for corrections and is quite clean and minimalistic.

### Loyalty Cards

There is [Loyalty Card Keychain](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/protect.card_locker/) that is based on scanning the barcode or QR code and not the full photos.

Card can be easily exported into CSV and backed-up.

### Other apps

- [ScreanStream](https://www.f-droid.org/en/packages/info.dvkr.screenstream/) is a great app for screen sharing. It broadcasts screen from your phone to the local network, so it is available on address like `192.168.0.24:8080`.
