# Financially Soveregin: Lightning Wallet to spend your Bitcoin

Sovereign Individual does spends his/hers money without permission, so all custodial wallets are out of any discussion.

### Best Mobile Wallet
The best wallet is [OBV](https://sbw.app/) made by [Anton Kumaigorodski](https://twitter.com/akumaigorodski) who sadly, after he Ruzzian invasion into Ukraine, turned his attention somewhere else. So project became abandoned. But there is promissing fork of [OBW - The Open Bitcoin Wallet](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/obw). 

- 🤖 Android only (sorry, prisoners of the Apple's walled garden)
- However it [still waits for its release on F-Droid](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/obw/issues/17)

### Using your Full Node
There is [Zeus⚡](https://zeusln.app/). It works over Tor 🧅. You just connect to your node, and you can pay from it. See [documentation](https://docs.zeusln.app/category/connecting-zeus) for how to connect to it from various node solutions.

> ❗❗❗ **IMPORTANT**: This can be security issue for you node. If you have significant amount of money on your node, anyone who gets acceess to your phone can steal it! ❗❗❗
